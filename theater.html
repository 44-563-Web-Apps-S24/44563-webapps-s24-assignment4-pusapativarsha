    <p class="speech">Somehow, I don't seem to want any.</p>

    <h5 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Then will you have a little vodka instead?</p>

    <h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h5>
    <p class="speech">No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot now.</p>
    <p class="direction">[A pause]</p>
    <p class="speech">Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other?</p>

    <p class="speech">Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died; that was eleven years ago--</p>
    <p class="direction">[thoughtfully]</p>
    <p class="speech">perhaps more.</p>

    <h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF.</h5>
    <p class="speech"> Have I changed much since then?</p>

    <h5 class="MARINA">MARINA.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too.</p>

    <h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI.</h5>
