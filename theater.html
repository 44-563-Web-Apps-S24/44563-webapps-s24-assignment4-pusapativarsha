    <h1>Varsha Pusapati does Chekov tonight</h1>
    <h3 style="color:green;">UNCLE VANYA</h3>
    <p><b>MARINA.</b><p style="color:red;">[Pouring some tea into a glass]</p>Take a little tea, my son.</p>
    <p><b>ASTROFF.</b><p style="color:red;">[Takes the glass from her unwillingly]</p>Somehow, I don't seem to want any.</p>
    <p><b>MARINA.</b><p>Then will you have a little vodka instead?</p></p>
    <p><b>ASTROFF.</b><p>No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot now. [A pause] Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other?</p></p>
    <p><b>MARINA.</b><p style="color:red;">[Thoughtfully]</p>Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died; that was eleven years ago--<p style=color:red;">[thoughtfully] perhaps more.</p>
    <p><b>ASTROFF.</b><p>Have I changed much since then?</p></p>
    <p><b>MARINA.</b><p>Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too.</p></p>
