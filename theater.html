    UNCLE VANYA




ACT I

A country house on a terrace. In front of it a garden. In an avenue of
trees, under an old poplar, stands a table set for tea, with a samovar,
etc. Some benches and chairs stand near the table. On one of them is
lying a guitar. A hammock is swung near the table. It is three o'clock
in the afternoon of a cloudy day.

<b>MARINA.</b><p style="color:red;">[Pouring some tea into a glass]</p>Take a little tea, my son.

<b>ASTROFF.</b><p style="color:red;">[Takes the glass from her unwillingly]</p> Somehow, I don't seem to
want any.

<b>MARINA.</b>Then will you have a little vodka instead?

<b>ASTROFF.</b>No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot
now.<p style="color:red;">[A pause]</p>Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other?

<b>MARINA.</b><p style="color:red;">[Thoughtfully]</p>Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to
remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was
it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died;
that was eleven years ago--<p style="color:red;">[thoughtfully]</p>perhaps more.

<b>ASTROFF.</b> Have I changed much since then?

<b>MARINA.</b> Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an
old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too.

<b>MARINA.</b> Don't you want a bite of something to eat?

<b>MARINA.</b> Man is forgetful, but God remembers.

<b>ASTROFF.</b> Thank you for that. You have spoken the truth.

<b>VOITSKI.</b> H'm. Yes.<p style="color:red;">[A pause]</p> Yes.

<b>ASTROFF.</b> Have you been asleep?</pre>
